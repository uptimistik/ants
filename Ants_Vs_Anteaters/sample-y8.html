INTRODUCTION:
This HTML document and related files are a working example of how to embed a
GameSalad HTML5 game into a website. In all, the necessary files include:

1. A snippet of HTML elements. (see below: "gse-player" element)
2. Some CSS declarations. (see file: gse-style.css)
3. The JavaScript engine file. (see below: script tags)
4. Some ad-hoc JavaScript code to configure and initialize the game. (see below:
   script tags)
5. The directory of game data and assets.


HOW TO:
Very broadly, there are two common scenarios to embed your game in a webpage.
Your choice will depend on the layout and requirements of your site.

Scenario 1: iframe
Create a separate dedicated page based on this source that only runs the game.
Then embed that page into another page's layout using an iframe tag. This setup
is the simplest.

Scenario 2: inline
Integrate all the necessary elements into one HTML page by copying and tailoring
pieces from of this source. This setup may save some extra web requests, as well
as allowing more complicated layering of the game and other HTML elements.

CSS STYLE:
The file gse-style.css contains the essential rules required for the engine to
display properly. However, there are some customizable considerations:

What appears before the game is loaded? The game will not draw anything until
the first scene begins. Until then, you can show something else by layering
elements underneath or on top of the player.

What appears behind the game as it plays? If the game doesn't scale to fit the
player area or it uses letterboxing, then there will be empty space around the
player. You can control what appears in that area either by layering elements
underneath the player or by setting the background-color or background-image.

What appears during loading? This document implements a very simple loading
animation. It can be customized by replacing the image and modifying the CSS
styling. Or you can modify the JavaScript code to make a different experience.

LOADING SCRIPT:
Here we define a callback function and pass it as an argument to gse.ready().
After the engine has loaded and initialized, it will invoke our callback. At a
minimum, we must tell the engine where to draw [with engine.setRenderFrame()]
and where to find the game assets [with engine.play()].

We can also tinker with some engine options and hook into game events via the
delegate pattern.

We must call gse.ready() after the engine file has loaded. There are a few ways
to accomplish this. See the section below for more detail on that.
